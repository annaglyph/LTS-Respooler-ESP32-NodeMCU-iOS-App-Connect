# LTS Respooler ‚Äì ESP32 NodeMCU (WEMOS D1 Mini) Edition

This project is a **stripped-down version** of the [LTS Respooler](https://github.com/LukasT03/LTS-Respooler), adapted to run on the **WEMOS D1 Mini ESP32 (ESP-WROOM-32)**.  

The LTS Respooler is a motorized tool for **respolling 3D printer filament**. It connects via **Bluetooth** to the official **LTS iOS app** or the [LTS Design Web App](https://lts-design.com/pages/software), allowing you to start/stop spooling, change direction, and monitor progress.

This version keeps the **core functionality** but removes some of the advanced features so it will fit and run reliably on a smaller ESP32 NodeMCU board.

The majority of the code was originally written by [Lukas Tuchscherer](https://github.com/LukasT03) while the **LTS iOS app** was in TestFlight.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Changes from the Original Project

The current [LTS Respooler](https://github.com/LukasT03/LTS-Respooler) firmware includes OTA updates, WiFi scanning, fan control, LED effects, torque monitoring, and adjustable motor strength.  

In order to fit the sketch on the WEMOS D1 Mini ESP32, this fork **does not implement**:
- OTA updates  
- WiFi scanning and connection  
- Fan control  
- LED status patterns (basic LED feedback only)  
- Torque monitoring  
- Motor strength adjustments  

Everything else, including **Bluetooth connectivity to the LTS apps**, remains supported.
